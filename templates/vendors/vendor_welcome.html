	Greetings from Meeraq!!
</p>
<br />
<p class="child-para">We are thrilled to let you know regarding our new vendor's platform. Here you can:</p>
<p class="child-para">
<p>1. View all your Purchase Orders.</p>
<p>2. Generate invoice against the orders.</p>
<p>3. Track the status of invoices.</p>
</p>
<br />
<p class="child-para">
	Now you don't have to create your invoices manually and no need to send a mail with the attached invoice. Meeraq
	platform will take care of this when you create an invoice here.
</p>
<br />

<p class="child-para">
	What you can't do:
</p>
<p class="child-para">1. You cannot raise invoices for the expense incurred.</p>
<br />

<p class="child-para">
	We will be rolling out this feature in later version.
